    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

    <!-- Motivation Paragraph -->
    <p>
        Technology has always fascinated me, and I believe software development is the perfect blend of logic and creativity. 
        The ability to build applications that solve real-world problems and make people's lives easier is what excites me the most. 
        From a young age, I have been curious about how websites and software work behind the scenes. This curiosity led me to explore 
        programming languages, algorithms, and full-stack development. As I continue learning, my goal is to contribute meaningfully to the tech industry 
        and create innovative solutions that can make an impact.
